# HI I'm Domantas! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github Profile I'm a linux system administrator that likes to code on some little projects sometimes i like doing graphic desing and drone sky photography etc.

## âœŒ About Me:
Since I was twelve years old, I have been interested in Linux systems. In the last four years, I have produced a number of projects.I intend to keep tying Linux computers to my future, research their security in greater detail, and broaden my knowledge of cybersecurity.
